# ✏️ prp_inventory
This resource is basically "Redesign of ox_inventory", all credits of FiveM scripts (backend) goes to [Overextended](https://github.com/overextended) and their [ox_inventory](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory) script. I'm working on v1.0.0 where I want to
implement custom crafting and shop system, like ProdigyRP has.
## 📃 Installation
Installation guide is very easy. Just replace build folder (web/build) with mine build folder. Enjoy this redesign 😉.
